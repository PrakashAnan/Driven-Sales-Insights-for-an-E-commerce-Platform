# Data-Driven Sales Insights for an E-commerce Platform

## About the Project

This project is a hands-on analysis of sales, customer behavior, and delivery performance using real-world e-commerce data. It’s built entirely in SQL and designed to reflect the kind of insights a Data Analyst would be expected to deliver in a business setting.

Over the course of this project, I explored how customers interact with the platform, what patterns exist in purchases and cancellations, and how key metrics like revenue, discounts, and user retention can be tracked and improved.

## What I Did

- Wrote SQL queries to calculate more than **25+ business KPIs**
- Analyzed customer trends (e.g., who placed orders within 7 days of signup)
- Identified restaurants and agents with high cancellation or reassignment rates
- Measured revenue growth over time and by category
- Found top-performing items and cities based on sales volume
- Tracked user inactivity (users who haven't ordered in 90+ days)
- Worked with real case scenarios like late deliveries and discount usage

## Tools & Skills Used

- **SQL**: Joins, CTEs, window functions, aggregations, filtering
- **CSV**: Raw data files used for simulation
- **Microsoft Word**: Documentation and business summary

## Why This Project Matters

This isn’t just a set of queries — it’s built to simulate the kind of thinking, problem-solving, and communication you'd need as a Data Analyst in a real company.

The goal was to treat it like a mini case-study: not just “write a query,” but actually understand what the business wants to know — and use SQL to get answers.
